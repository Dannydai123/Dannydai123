- I work out of Shanghai, CHINA.  but I love to know about andlearn western culture and talk to others.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...anything I can be of help.
- I recently refreshed on object oriented design and analysis , design pattern. read uncle bob and Martin fowler's books and practice using UML. those are great tools.  but some new programing styles might not follow those traditional thoughts.
